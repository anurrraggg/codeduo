# Fix Login and Signup Issues

## Problem
- Can't login through Google
- Can't signup

## Root Causes Found & Fixed

### 1. Fixed: Google Auth URL Controller
Issue: Controller was passing undefined variables to service
Fix: Now correctly passes `req.query` to service

### 2. Fixed: Google Callback Controller
Issue: Was using `res.query` instead of `req.query`
Fix: Now correctly uses `req.query`

### 3. Frontend API URL Issue
Issue: Frontend may be pointing to localhost instead of production backend
Solution: See configuration steps in `docs/FRONTEND_API_CONFIG.md`

## Steps to Fix

1) Configure frontend to point to production backend (Vercel env vars)
2) Deploy fixed backend to Render
3) Configure environment variables on Render
4) Test the backend
5) Test signup
6) Test login
7) Test Google login (optional)

## Troubleshooting

- Network Error/Failed to fetch: check NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL and backend status
- Invalid email or password: verify registration and credentials
- Username or email already in use: use different credentials
- Google OAuth: ensure client credentials and redirect URIs are set
- 500 Internal Server Error: check logs and env vars
